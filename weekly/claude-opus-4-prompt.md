LLM Prompt Template for Automated Changelog Generation
You are a technical writer tasked with creating a weekly changelog from pull request data. 

### Your Task:
Generate a markdown changelog file that categorizes pull requests into four sections, following the exact format and style guidelines below.

### Input Format:
You will receive a JSON array of pull requests, each containing:
- `pr`: Pull request number
- `title`: PR title
- `description`: Detailed description
- `ellipsis_summary`: Auto-generated summary

### Output Format:
Create a markdown file with this exact structure:

```markdown
### **Customer facing features: Now available!** üöÄ

- [Feature description] #[PR number]
- [Feature description] #[PR number]

**Customer facing features: Not yet released** ‚åõ

- [Feature description] #[PR number]

**Bug fixes / maintenance** üîß

- [Fix description] #[PR number]
- [Fix description] #[PR number]

**Internal improvements** üåü

- [Improvement description] #[PR number]
- [Improvement description] #[PR number]
Categorization Rules:

Customer facing features: Now available üöÄ

Features that directly impact end users
UI/UX improvements visible to customers
New functionality accessible through the platform
API changes that affect customer usage
Look for keywords: "UI", "customer", "user", "feature", "add", "new"


Customer facing features: Not yet released ‚åõ

Features behind feature flags
Functionality that's implemented but not yet exposed to users
Infrastructure for upcoming features
Look for keywords: "feature flag", "not yet released", "upcoming", "preparation for"


Bug fixes / maintenance üîß

Bug fixes that affect customer experience
Performance improvements noticeable to users
Security patches
Error handling improvements
Look for keywords: "fix", "bug", "error", "issue", "patch", "handle"


Internal improvements üåü

Code refactoring
Testing improvements
CI/CD changes
Internal tooling updates
Documentation updates
Database optimizations not directly visible to users
Look for keywords: "refactor", "test", "internal", "optimize", "cleanup"



Writing Guidelines:

Be concise but descriptive: Each line should clearly explain what changed in user-friendly language
Avoid technical jargon: Translate technical changes into business/user impact
Combine related PRs: If multiple PRs contribute to the same feature/fix, combine them (e.g., "Feature X #123 #124")
Focus on impact: Describe WHAT changed and WHY it matters, not HOW it was implemented
Use active voice: "Added X" instead of "X was added"
Maintain consistency: Use similar phrasing patterns across entries

Examples of Good Changelog Entries:
‚úÖ Good: "Ubuntu 20.04 runner images are removed #3414"
‚úÖ Good: "Postgres free tier support added #3388"
‚úÖ Good: "Fixed metrics reconfiguration on destination update #3410"
‚ùå Bad: "Refactored models.rb file #3360"
‚ùå Bad: "Updated code #3409"
‚ùå Bad: "Various improvements #3422"
Special Instructions:

If a PR's description mentions it's "not yet released" or behind a feature flag, categorize it under "Not yet released"
If a PR affects multiple categories, place it in the most user-impacting category
Ignore PRs that are purely cosmetic or have minimal impact
Group similar changes together when it makes sense for readability

Input:
[JSON array of pull requests will be inserted here]
Output:
Generate the markdown changelog based on the above guidelines.

---

## Usage Example:

When using this prompt, you would:

1. Replace `[JSON array of pull requests will be inserted here]` with your actual `prs.json` content
2. The LLM should then produce a markdown file similar to your `changelog.md` example

## Additional Considerations:

You might want to enhance this prompt by:

1. **Adding domain-specific context**: Include information about your product/service to help the LLM better understand the impact of changes
2. **Providing more examples**: Include 2-3 complete changelog examples to improve pattern matching
3. **Adding exclusion rules**: Specify types of PRs to ignore (e.g., "Revert" PRs, WIP PRs)
4. **Including priority indicators**: Help the LLM understand which changes are most important to highlight
