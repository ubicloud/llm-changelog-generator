We generate a change log for our products every week. For this, we use completed pull requests for the week. We then group pull requests into four categories: (1) customer facing features: now available, (2) customer facing features: not yet released, (3) bug fixes and maintenance, and (4) internal improvements. Our change log then includes (1) customer facing features that are available.

I'm including (a) our pull requests for this week in json format to this prompt (prs.json). In this prompt, you're going to find (i) each completed pull request that has a pr number, title, description, and an auto generated ellipsis summary.

We use these pull requests to create a weekly changelog file similar to the attached markdown file (b) (changelog.md). This markdown file groups PRs into customer facing features (released), customer facing features (not yet released), Bug Fixes/Maintenance and Internal Improvements. Every line corresponds to one or more PRs and PR numbers are included at the end.

If I wanted to automate this process through an LLM, what type of a prompt should I generate to feed into the LLM? I'd like the LLM then to take input as pull-requests.json and produce an mdx file for the weem that's our change log.
